# Configuration for Trotter error analysis test
# This file tests how dt and svd_min affect thermal state accuracy

# System parameters
n: 10
hamiltonian: "tf_ising_ferro.yml"
beta: 0.1

# Hamiltonian couplings
couplings:
  g: 0.5

# Operators to test
# Include both single-site and multi-site operators to see how correlations are affected
operators:
  - "IIIIIIIIII"   # Identity (should always be 1)
  - "IIIIIZIIII"   # Single-site Z
  - "IIIIIZZIII"   # Two-site correlation (most sensitive to truncation error)
  - "IIIIIZZZII"   # Three-site correlation
  - "IIIIIXXIII"   # X correlation (should be ~0)

# Timesteps to test (in ascending order)
dts:
  - 1.0e-3
  - 1.0e-4
  - 1.0e-5
  - 1.0e-6

# SVD cutoffs to test (in descending order)
# 0 means no truncation (only chi_max constraint)
svd_mins:
  - 1.e-10
  - 1.e-12
  - 1.e-14

# Maximum bond dimensions to test
chi_maxs:
  - 4
  - 16
  - 32
